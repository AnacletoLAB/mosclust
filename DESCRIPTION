Title: Model order selection for clustering
Author: Giorgio Valentini <valenti@dsi.unimi.it>

Depends: stats, MASS, clusterv
Description: Stability based methods for model order selection in clustering problems. 
	Using multiple perturbations of the data the stability of clustering solutions is assessed. Different
	perturbations may be used: resampling techniques, random projections and noise injection. Stability measures
	for the estimate of clustering solutions and statistical tests to assess their significance are provided.
