Description: Stability based methods for model order selection in clustering problems 
    (Valentini, G (2007), <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btl600>. 
    Using multiple perturbations of the data the stability of clustering solutions is assessed. Different 
    perturbations may be used: resampling techniques, random projections and noise injection. Stability measures 
    for the estimate of clustering solutions and statistical tests to assess their significance are provided.
